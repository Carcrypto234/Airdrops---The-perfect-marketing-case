So this is my point of view of someone who is in this industry for more than 4 years and have seeing a lot of companies doing airdrop campaigns 
First point here is that I'm not a marketing guy , this is just my opinion from what a have seeing in all this years
So the center narrative in the airdrops around 4 years back was the the L2 airdrops was the hype, a lot of users have made a good amount with optmism with arbitrum, and the farming of L2 was just enormous
A lot of L2 in the market that has complety vanish from the market, I rembember Blast doing a big campaign, 

Today looking at the market i see the perpdex is a big hype and everyone today is farming perpdex, mostly because hyperliquid done an incredible job
