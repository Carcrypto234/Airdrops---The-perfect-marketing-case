Imagine this scenario

A companie want to bring real value from what is building, and is doing a serius job with real purpose
So the way of bringing ney people and atract money is doing marketing stuff, you need to be seen 
But now you have in your hand as a serious company at the same time 
Changes people life
Grow your product
Create a loyatly users base, that really care about your product and want to bring value from inside
This is the correct way of seeing airdrops
Let's analyse the hyperliquid case
It's a perpdex, people already know they have a big potential of losing money.
They come with a serious product, with a serious team that want to solve a real probleam of the users.
The team is serious and is not just looking for the money in the pocket
They want to bring real value to the cryptmarket and build something that can change the market
They need users
Run a airdrop campaing with hidden points and clear points
Everyone that used the product and helped build the product earn a amount of tokens of the company, i see this as a sharing of stocks
